ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Anthony!
I love creating amazing things with code! My journey in programming began when when I was studying for a master's degree in machine learning. Since then, I can't stop! ðŸ’»âœ¨

ðŸŽ“ Education
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics, where I developed a strong foundation in economic theory, quantitative analysis, and data interpretation. My undergraduate studies equipped me with the skills to understand complex economic systems and the factors that drive financial decision-making.
Following my passion for technology and data, I pursued a Master's degree in Machine Learning. This advanced program deepened my knowledge of algorithms, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence. Through hands-on projects and research, I gained practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, bridging the gap between economics and technology. 

ðŸ’» Technical Skills
- Python;
- C++;
- Machine Learning.

ðŸŽ¨ My Hobbies
Programming: I enjoy playing with my Python and neural networks.
Gaming: When I'm not coding, I dive into the world of video games (Tons of games, im a gamer, u know ðŸ¤™).
